# **Improved MergeSort**

## **Summary**

This project focuses on optimizing the classic MergeSort algorithm by introducing a hybrid approach that uses InsertionSort for sorting small sublists.  
Through experimental testing, the impact of different sublist size thresholds (`k`) on overall performance was analyzed and compared against standard MergeSort and QuickSort implementations.

## **Objectives**

- Implement an Improved MergeSort that uses InsertionSort for sublists smaller than a defined threshold.
- Analyze the effect of varying the threshold (`k`) on execution time.
- Compare the performance of the Improved MergeSort against standard MergeSort and QuickSort.
- Validate the empirical complexity of the algorithm and confirm its correctness across multiple test cases.

## **Conclusion**

This project explored the optimization of the classic MergeSort algorithm by introducing a hybrid approach that uses InsertionSort for small sublists.

Through experimental analysis, it was demonstrated that:
- Dividing the list into sublists of approximately 16 elements significantly improves execution time.
- The Improved MergeSort consistently outperforms both standard MergeSort and QuickSort across various input sizes.
- The optimization becomes increasingly effective as the list size grows, confirming better scalability.

These results validate the strategy of combining simple sorting algorithms for small data blocks with more complex algorithms for larger merges, achieving a balance between overhead and sorting efficiency.  
Future work could focus on fine-tuning the threshold dynamically based on system performance or dataset characteristics.

## **Project Structure**

The repository is organized into the following components:

- **Individual Algorithm Folders**:  
  Each sorting algorithm is placed in its own folder. The ImprovedMergeSort folder contains a detailed explanation in its corresponding `README.md`. For the other algorithms, refer to my other project: [Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/ByronVelasco/SortingAlgorithms).

- **`Tests/` Folder**:  
  Contains test scripts that evaluate the correctness and behavior of each sorting algorithm.

- **`img/` Folder**:  
  Stores the output images generated during experimentation.

- **`4 ComplexityMachine/` Folder**:  
  Contains the notebook `ComplexityMachine.ipynb`, which performs the experimental analysis of sorting algorithms and presents the conclusions.

## **How to Run This Project**

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ByronVelasco/ImprovedMergeSort.git
   cd ImprovedMergeSort

2. **Install the required libraries**
   
   Make sure you have Python installed (preferably 3.8+), then install the dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Open the main notebook**
   
   Use your preferred Python environment (like Jupyter, VS Code, or Google Colab) and open:

   ```
   4 ComplexityMachine/ComplexityMachine.ipynb

4. **Run** the cells to perform the experiments and generate the visualizations.

   The results will be displayed directly in the notebook, and the corresponding graphs will be saved in the `img/` folder.

## **Final Note**

The system developed for this project was created solely for academic purposes. It is not designed to be an optimal or production-grade benchmarking tool.
